ReXWB

What is it?
-----------
This little tool allow to resample a xwb file.

xwb are WaveBank sound bank from XNA framework.
This tool allow to take individual file and change the sample rate.

It has been tested only with the wavebanks of Stardew Valley.


How to build
------------
You will need libsox to build.
It should work on any linux distrib, but you probably a fairly recent GCC version (I used 7.3).
Create a `build` sufolder and simple `cmake` and `make` should work...
so basicaly, from the freshly cloned folder:

`mkdir build`

`cd build`

`cmake ..`

`make`

How to launch
-------------

You need at least 3 argument: infile.wxb outfile.wxb rate
you can also use `-f` to force the MS ADPCM sound to be converted to PCM 16bits. PCM are 4 times bigger then ADPCM, but the loading time of thegame should be shorter, and conversion time too (but resulting wxb file will be bigger)
An example could be:

`./rewxb Content/XACT/Wave\ Bank.wxb new.wxb 11025 -f`
Another optionnal parameter is `-p`, in that case no verbose message is shown, only a percentage number (to be used with a zenity progress bar).

Note that input and output wxb file *MUST* be different.
